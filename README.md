<h1 align="center">Groundwater flow equation: Finite-difference forward, adjoint, and gradient operators</h1>

This repository contains the code for implementing the finite-difference
forward, adjoint, and gradient operators for the groundwater flow equation.
The operators are implemented via
[Devito](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito), a finite-difference
domain-specific language for solving partial differential equations that
generates optimized C code depending on the target architecture.
